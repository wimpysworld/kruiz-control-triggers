# Kruiz Control Triggers

I use the excellent [Kruiz Control](https://github.com/Kruiser8/Kruiz-Control) to automate OBS Studio during my live streams and to create a Twitch chatbot.

> *Kruiz Control enables a pseudo code approach to manage and automatically handle Twitch Channel Points, Twitch Chat, OBS or SLOBS, and StreamElements or Streamlabs alerts.*

This repository contains the triggers I use for my live stream.
I have split them into two repositories, one for my Twitch channel points triggers and automations, and one for my Twitch chatbot.
They are published here for anyone to learn from, *but they are not intended to be plug-and-play*.

### DecAPI

I use [DecAPI](https://decapi.me/) to get the data from the Twitch API and have implemented a DecAPI client using Kruiz Control.
